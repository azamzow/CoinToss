# CoinToss Project

### Description

This is a small Java project used to instantiate a class, and its methods, while getting familiar with UML class diagrams. The CoinToss program selects a random numer between 1 and 2, (1 being heads, 2 being tails). It then gathers the users input to calculate If the guess is equal or not equal to the computers random toss.

### To Run

Using terminal on Mac,

```
$ cd CoinToss
$ javac CoinToss.java
$ java CoinToss
```

### Output

Below is an example of the program executed. (Remeber, each time the program uses random numbers, so the output wont always look like this)

```
Enter your guess 4 times..... Enter Heads or Tails to work
Whats your guess, heads or tails?
